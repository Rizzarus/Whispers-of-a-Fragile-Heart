    <h1>Chapter 1: The Childhood Past</h1>
    <p>Act 1</p>
    <p>The Childhood Past</p>
    <p>Yumi and Kazuha were childhood friends they protect each other’s back, treating each other right. Their bonds were unbreakable the power of friendship that they hold is very strong than a regular friendship. This friendship was very special that couldn’t break into pieces. Kazuha and Yumi were neighbors they always play together day to night, that’s how strong their bonds are.</p>
    <p>Yumi
-”Kazuha! Look what I found! A big frog!”</p>
    <p>Kazuha
-”Get that thing away from me! That’s so gross!”</p>
    <p>Yumi laughed mischievously, holding the wriggling frog in her hands. She moved closer to Kazuha, teasing him with the amphibian.</p>
    <p>Yumi
-"Oh, come on, Kazuha! Don't be such a scaredy-cat. It's just a little frog."</p>
    <p>Kazuha took a step back, feigning fear as he tried to dodge Yumi's playful advances.</p>
    <p>Kazuha
 -"I can't help it, Yumi! You know how I feel about slimy creatures. Put that thing away before it jumps on me!"</p>
    <p>Yumi, still giggling, complied and released the frog back into the grass.</p>
    <p>Yumi
- "Fine, fine. No more frogs for you. But you owe me ice cream for saving you from its evil clutches!"</p>
    <p>Kazuha smiled, relief washing over him as he realized he had escaped the frog's wrath.</p>
    <p>Kazuha
- "Deal! Ice cream it is then. Just no more surprises like that, okay?"</p>
    <p>Their laughter echoed through the neighborhood, their innocent joy painting the scene with warmth and familiarity. Little did they know that the years ahead would test their friendship in ways they never anticipated.</p>
    <p>The sun painted the playground with a warm golden hue as Kazuha and Yumi ran hand in hand, their laughter echoing in the air. They were immersed in a lively game of tag, their tiny legs carrying them across the colorful jungle gym and through the maze of slides.</p>
    <p>As the game escalated, their excitement soared, and Yumi's infectious giggles filled the air. Unbeknownst to her, Kazuha's heart, burdened by his delicate condition, began to ache with each beat. But the joy of being with Yumi masked the pain, and he pressed on, determined to keep up.
</p>
    <p>They paused for a moment near a set of swings, catching their breath. Kazuha's small chest rose and fell rapidly, his heart straining under the weight of his exhilaration. He tried to suppress the growing discomfort, fearing that it would spoil their fun-filled day.</p>
    <p>Yumi, her eyes gleaming with mischief, suddenly proposed a new game—a race to the highest point of the jungle gym. Kazuha's heart tightened with both excitement and apprehension, knowing the strain it would place on his fragile organ. But he couldn't resist Yumi's infectious enthusiasm.</p>
    <p>They sprinted towards the towering structure, their little legs pumping with all their might. Kazuha's heart pounded in his chest, each beat accompanied by a sharp pang of pain. But he clenched his teeth, refusing to let it show. Determined to keep up with Yumi, he pushed himself to his limits.</p>
    <p>As they reached the top, Yumi cheered in triumph, oblivious to the silent battle raging within Kazuha. He tried to catch his breath, his hand instinctively resting over his chest, hoping the pain would subside. Yet, the ache persisted, intensifying with each passing second.</p>
    <p>Feeling the weight of the moment, Kazuha forced a smile, not wanting to dampen Yumi's spirits. He mustered all his strength to join in her jubilant celebration, hiding the agony that danced behind his eyes. But as they descended from the jungle gym, his steps faltered, and a sudden dizziness consumed him.
</p>
    <p>Yumi noticed the change, concern etched across her face. She took his hand, her touch offering a small measure of comfort. Little did she know the silent battle he fought—the battle between his longing to play with her and the limitations of his fragile heart.
</p>
    <p>With a soft voice and a pained smile, Kazuha mustered the strength to say, "Yumi, let's take a break for a moment. My heart needs a rest." His words hung heavy in the air, revealing a glimpse of the struggle he faced, hidden beneath his youthful innocence.</p>
    <p>Yumi's eyes widened with realization, her joy fading into concern. She wrapped her arms around Kazuha in a tender embrace, feeling the frailty of his existence against her own. In that poignant moment, the weight of their unspoken love and the cruel reality of Kazuha's condition enveloped them both, setting the stage for a love story that would unfold with bittersweet emotions and heart-wrenching choices.
</p>
    <p>As the dawn falls Kazuha told his mother what happened to him earlier and explained every detail as possible, her mother was shocked and very concerned and her mother decided to take him to a hospital and have a checkup tomorrow.</p>
    <p>The next day. Kazuha's mother, Haruka, watched her son with a mix of concern and anticipation as they sat in the doctor's office. She held his hand tightly, providing him the support he needed in this moment of uncertainty. The doctor, a kind-faced man, entered the room, carrying a solemn expression that betrayed the news he held.</p>
    <p>"Mrs. Yamamoto, Kazuha," the doctor began, his voice gentle yet tinged with sadness. "I'm afraid the results of Kazuha's tests reveal a serious illness—a fragile heart condition."</p>
    <p>Haruka's heart skipped a beat, her eyes welling up with tears. She glanced at Kazuha, who stared back at her with a mixture of confusion and fear.</p>
    <p>"What does that mean, doctor?" Haruka asked, her voice trembling.</p>
    <p>The doctor continued, explaining the nature of Kazuha's condition. He emphasized the need for caution and how overexertion or intense emotions could potentially lead to heart failure. Haruka's mind swirled with questions, her thoughts consumed by worries for her beloved son.</p>
    <p>The doctor's voice resonated with a mix of empathy and medical expertise as he uttered the words that would forever alter Kazuha's life:</p>
    <p>"Kazuha, you have a rare and delicate heart condition called cardiac fragility syndrome. It means that your heart is vulnerable to strain, and even the slightest excess of emotions or physical exertion could lead to irreversible damage and heart failure."</p>
    <p>Kazuha's young eyes widened with a mixture of comprehension and sorrow. He instinctively clutched his chest, as if feeling the weight of his fragile heart for the first time.</p>
    <p>"I'm sorry, Kazuha," the doctor said softly, "but you will need to avoid activities that could strain your heart. It's important to be mindful of your emotions and take measures to protect your health."</p>
    <p>Silence engulfed the room as the weight of the news settled upon them. Kazuha's playful innocence, once an armor against the world's troubles, now felt fragile, as if it could shatter at any moment. Tears welled up in his eyes, mirroring his mother's anguish.</p>
    <p>Haruka, mustering her strength, enveloped Kazuha in a tender embrace, whispering words of love and reassurance. She vowed to protect him, to shield him from anything that could harm his fragile heart.</p>
    <p>As they left the doctor's office, a newfound sense of fragility pervaded their lives. Kazuha clung to his mother's hand, seeking solace in her unwavering support. In that moment, their bond deepened, intertwining their fates as they embarked on a journey filled with both love and the looming shadow of loss.</p>
    <p>Together, they faced the daunting task of keeping Kazuha's condition a secret, protecting him from the emotional turmoil that lay ahead. It was a burden no child should bear, but Kazuha, with his gentle spirit, accepted his fate with a quiet resilience that belied his tender age.</p>
    <p>As the weight of his illness settled upon his young shoulders, Kazuha's thoughts turned to Yumi—his dear friend, his confidante. He wondered how he could shield her from the truth, how he could continue to cherish their friendship without revealing the depths of his own heartache.</p>
    <p>Little did Kazuha know that this secret would not only shape his own destiny but also pave the way for a story of unrequited love and heart-wrenching sacrifices that would captivate the hearts of those who witnessed it.</p>
    <p>Kazuha's mother, HARUKA, sits anxiously across from the doctor, DR. TAKEDA. Her eyes are filled with a mixture of hope and trepidation. Kazuha, a young boy with a gentle demeanor, clings to her side.</p>
    <p>The day after his checkup Kazuha and his mother went again to the doctor’s office. Kazuha is feeling sadness quitely knowing that his illness has no cure.</p>
    <p>DR. TAKEDA
(softly)
-“Mrs. Yamamoto, I understand this is overwhelming news. But it's important to know that cardiac fragility syndrome doesn't have a known cure at the moment.”</p>
    <p>HARUKA
(worried)
-“Doctor, is there anything we can do? Are there treatments or medications that can help my son?”
</p>
    <p>DR. TAKEDA
(sincerely)
-“I wish I could offer you a straightforward solution, Mrs. Yamamoto. Unfortunately, the treatment options for cardiac fragility syndrome are limited. We can manage the symptoms and take preventive measures, but we cannot completely reverse or cure the underlying condition.”</p>
    <p>HARUKA's eyes well up with tears as she grasps Kazuha's hand tighter.</p>
    <p>HARUKA
(desperate)
-“Please, doctor. There must be something we can do to help Kazuha. Is there no chance of improvement?”
</p>
    <p>DR. TAKEDA
(gently)
-“I understand your concern, Mrs. Yamamoto. We will do everything we can to support Kazuha and provide him with the best quality of life. It's crucial to monitor his physical activities and emotions closely, ensuring he avoids any situations that could strain his heart. Regular checkups and adherence to a prescribed treatment plan will be essential.”
</p>
    <p>HARUKA looks at Kazuha, her eyes brimming with determination.</p>
    <p>HARUKA
(resolute)
-“Thank you, doctor. We will do whatever it takes to protect Kazuha's health and happiness. We won't let this condition define him.”</p>
    <p>DR. TAKEDA
(nodding)
-“I commend your strength, Mrs. Yamamoto. Remember, you're not alone in this journey. Our medical team will be here to provide guidance and support along the way.”</p>
    <p>HARUKA takes a deep breath, steeling herself for the challenges that lie ahead.</p>
    <p>HARUKA
(firmly)
-“We will face this together, Doctor Takeda. Kazuha's fragile heart will not define him. We will make sure he lives a life filled with love and joy.”</p>
    <p>Kazuha looks up at his mother, finding solace in her unwavering determination. They share a silent bond, ready to embark on a path where their love will serve as a shield against the harsh reality of his condition.</p>
    <p>INT. KAZUHA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT</p>
    <p>Kazuha sits on his bed, his small frame engulfed in a mixture of confusion and sadness. The weight of the doctor's words still lingers in the air. Moonlight gently filters through the window, casting a somber glow in the room. Kazuha's mother, Haruka, enters the room, concern etched across her face. She sits down next to Kazuha, enveloping him in a comforting embrace.
</p>
    <p>HARUKA
(softly)
-”Kazuha, my dear, I know this news is hard to understand. But please know that we love you, and we'll face this challenge together.”</p>
    <p>Kazuha looks up at his mother, his eyes filled with a mixture of fear and vulnerability.</p>
    <p>
KAZUHA
(teary-eyed)
-”Mom... does this mean I can't do things like other kids? Will I always be sick?”</p>
    <p>Haruka gently wipes away Kazuha's tears, her voice filled with warmth and reassurance.</p>
    <p>HARUKA
(sincerely)
-”No, my sweet boy. You are not defined by your illness. We need to take precautions and be mindful of your health, but it doesn't mean you can't lead a fulfilling life. We'll find ways to make sure you're safe and happy.”</p>
    <p>Kazuha sniffles, contemplating his mother's words. His thoughts wander to his beloved friend, Yumi, and the fear of losing their carefree moments together.</p>
    <p>KAZUHA
(whispering)
-”What about Yumi, Mom? Will she still want to be my friend if she knows about my fragile heart?”</p>
    <p>Haruka's eyes soften with understanding as she holds Kazuha's hands, her voice filled with love.
</p>
    <p>HARUKA
-”Kazuha, true friendship is built on love and understanding. If Yumi truly cares for you, she will stand by your side through thick and thin. We'll find the right time to explain your condition to her, and I believe she will support you just as we do.”</p>
    <p>Kazuha takes a deep breath, a flicker of hope returning to his eyes. He realizes that he is not alone in this journey and that his heart, though fragile, is capable of immense love.</p>
    <p>KAZUHA
(resolute)
-”I won't let this illness hold me back, Mom. I'll cherish every moment, every friendship, and every smile, even more now.”
</p>
    <p>Haruka smiles, proud of her son's resilience and determination.
</p>
    <p>HARUKA
-”That's my brave boy. Remember, Kazuha, you are strong, and you have so much love to give. We'll navigate this together, one step at a time.”
</p>
    <p>They embrace once more, finding solace in their unbreakable bond. As they hold each other tightly, the moonlight illuminates their hope, casting a glimmer of light in the midst of darkness.</p>
    <p>As the night falls and the sun is setting in the horizon another day of school</p>
    <p>INT. SCHOOL CAFETERIA - DAY</p>
    <p>Kazuha sits at a lunch table, his eyes fixed on Yumi, who is engaged in a lively conversation with their classmates. He watches her laughter fill the air, the sunlight dancing in her hair. His heart swells with a mix of love and longing.</p>
    <p>Kazuha's hand instinctively goes to his chest, a gentle reminder of his fragile heart. He takes a deep breath, steeling himself to hide his condition from Yumi, determined not to burden her with his struggles.</p>
    <p>As Yumi approaches the table, a bright smile on her face, Kazuha puts on a brave facade.</p>
    <p>YUMI
(excitedly)
Hey, Kazuha! I have something to tell you. You won't believe what happened in class today!</p>
    <p>Kazuha forces a smile, masking his inner turmoil.</p>
    <p>KAZUHA
(enthusiastically)
What is it, Yumi? I'm all ears!</p>
    <p>They sit together, their conversation flowing effortlessly. Kazuha listens intently, cherishing every word, but his heart throbs with a hidden pain.</p>
    <p>A group of friends invites them to join a game of tag outside. Yumi's eyes light up with excitement, ready to embrace the joy of the moment.</p>
    <p>KAZUHA
(hesitant)
I...I think I'll sit this one out, guys. Got some homework to catch up on.</p>
    <p>YUMI
(concerned)
Are you sure, Kazuha? You always enjoy playing with us. We'll miss you.</p>
    <p>Kazuha musters a smile, trying to ease Yumi's worry.</p>
    <p>KAZUHA
(grinning)
It's alright, Yumi. I'll be cheering you all on from here. Go have fun!</p>
    <p>Yumi gives him a warm smile, but her concern lingers in her eyes as she joins the others outside.</p>
    <p>Kazuha watches them run off, a mix of emotions swirling within him. He yearns to be by Yumi's side, to share in her laughter and adventures. But he knows that to protect her from the truth, he must bear this painful secret alone.</p>
    <p>INT. KAZUHA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT</p>
    <p>Kazuha sits at his desk, his heart heavy with a tangle of emotions. He takes out a journal, his sanctuary for unspoken words and hidden feelings. With trembling hands, he pours his heart onto the pages, weaving his love for Yumi into every word.</p>
    <p>KAZUHA (V.O.)
(Yumi, my dearest friend, I wish I could tell you the truth. How my heart aches with each beat, not from sadness but from the love I hold for you. I will protect you, even if it means hiding this fragile heart of mine.)</p>
    <p>Tears stain the paper, a testament to the depth of his emotions. With each word, his love grows stronger, as does the weight of his secret.</p>
