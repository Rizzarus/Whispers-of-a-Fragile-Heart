    <h1>Prologue</h1>
    <p>Prolouge

The winds of fate whispered softly through the streets of a small, serene town. Among the cherry blossoms that gently swayed in the breeze, two children played, their laughter filling the air with a joy that seemed boundless.

Kazuha and Yumi, inseparable since their early years, formed an unbreakable bond as they explored the world with wide-eyed wonder. From chasing butterflies in the meadow to sharing secrets under the starlit sky, their friendship blossomed like the flowers that painted their surroundings.

But beneath their innocent smiles, a shadow loomed, unbeknownst to Yumi. Kazuha, with his infectious laughter and compassionate soul, carried a secret burden that he had kept hidden from herâ€”his ailing heart. Medical tests revealed a fragile organ, vulnerable to the dangers of overexertion and intense emotions.

Deep in his heart, Kazuha longed to express his love for Yumi. Yet, knowing the devastating consequences his confession could bring, he chose silence, his feelings remaining buried beneath the surface of their cherished friendship.

As they grew older, the once-boundless world began to expand before their eyes. High school beckoned with dreams and aspirations, pulling them on separate paths. Yumi's eyes glimmered with determination as she chased her dreams of higher education, while Kazuha watched from the sidelines, his heart aching at the thought of their inevitable separation.

With the passage of time, the weight of Kazuha's secret grew heavier. Each passing day, he battled against the emotions swelling within him, fearful that one wrong move could shatter the delicate threads of their bond. And so, he continued to love Yumi silently, like a whispered prayer carried away by the wind.

Little did they know that destiny had a cruel twist in store for them. Yumi, oblivious to Kazuha's true feelings, would soon cross paths with another person who would captivate her heart. As their friendship morphed into a budding romance, Kazuha watched from afar, his heartache hidden behind a brave facade.

And now, as the story unfolds, the threads that held their lives together begin to unravel. With each passing day, Kazuha's health deteriorates, his fragile heart stretched to its limits. The time for secrets and unspoken words is coming to an end, and the echoes of their intertwined lives reverberate in the wind, hinting at the inevitable storm that awaits them.

In this tale of love and sacrifice, the stage is set for a heart-wrenching journey, where Kazuha and Yumi will face the true depths of their emotions, the fragile nature of life, and the painful inevitability of a heartbreaking ending.</p>
